Discussion of STM8 SPL license status and next steps

There seem to be several parallel discussions with STM about the STM8-SPL license. I set up this repo (hoping this is the correct tool) to bring together the involved people I am aware of. Please feel free to participate in the discussion and to invite additional people as required.

Please open the "Issues" page for the actual discussion - or tell me a better tool for a team discussion...  ;-)

Thanks and have a great day,
Georg
