Discussion of STM8 SPL license status and next steps

There seem to be several parallel discussions with STM about the STM8-SPL license. I set up this repo (hoping this is the correct tool) to bring together the involved people I am aware of. Please feel free to participate in the discussion and to invite additional people as required.

In addition, patching the SPL for SDCC (like [here](https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch)) seems to become inappropriate, as Michael Mayer (aka tenbaht) has just released [a tool](https://github.com/tenbaht/spl-splitter) to split the SPL functions into separate files for linker optimization. If I publish this version as patch, I might just as well publich the complete SPL... 

Please open the "[Issues](https://github.com/STM8-SPL-license/discussion/issues)" page for the actual discussion - or tell me a better tool for a team discussion...  ;-)

Thanks and have a great day,
Georg
